1. What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I didn't struggle with understanding the Git concept. More so the main challenge was having learned one concept one day and then having to almost relearn the next day. It was easier the second time around but haven't committed to muscle memory. The hardest was pushing if anything.

2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Understanding what pushing, pulling, merging etc were. Laura was really helpful to clarify those as well as provide tidbits and little hacks like space . when writing git clone <url> to avoid creating a folder within a folder.

3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I hope I didn't ask too many questions as we did run over time (Sneha and I did finish afterwards). Most of my questions were to clarify concepts or ask why something was being done and if there was a better way. Also I would try to ask what my pair was doing when she was driving or how she felt about this or that. Just used questions as a form of keeping constant communication. 

4. What still confuses you about Git?
I would do pushing in various branches or from the master. Sneha and I actually ended up creating the Conflict not locally on the Terminal but instead by pushing both the Master and Small-conflict to Github we were able to see how to resolve conflict on both local repo and Github repo. Pretty cool. Making mistakes seems to be the right thing to do in learning to code.


5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I came into it very nervous. However it was AWESOME. I am looking forward to future pairing sessions and see the tremendous value in it. I'm sure there will be more challenging sessions but my first was terrific.
