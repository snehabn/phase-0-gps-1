What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was having some trouble understanding how to merge a feature-branch to the remote repository from Terminal.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
How to merge a feature-branch
How a pull requst works

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
Should we clone a repo into an freshly made directory?
What are some ways to look for command help in the terminal?
Do you need to be in your feature-directory to push it into the remote repository?
We also discussed some basic spatial orientation of where/what directory or feature-branches we were in and where we had to go to next.

What still confuses you about Git?
One thing I forgot to ask/discuss with my pairing partner and guide is the "git pull" command and method of application. I had been having some issues with that recently.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I was initially really nervous about my first pairing session and I'm happy to say that I had a lot of fun pairing in a GPS. Laura, our guide, was very helpful and provided really good insight into the Git workflow. I had a great time working with my pairing partner! I felt respected and heard and both of them took the time to pause and answer any questions I had along the way.
